    "# Example: Using Loman to Value a Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll look at valuing a simple portfolio composed of equities and futures. In additional, we'll calculate an intraday P&L, and some simple exposure measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of valuing and risk-managing a multi-asset portfolio is that each asset type must be treated differently. Position, market and static data for each asset type must typically be sourced from separate systems and then integrated into a single holistic view. Loman excels at this sort of task, making it easy to add new nodes as new sources of data become available, or as new calculations are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify exposition, we have deliberately limited the number of asset types we treat, and the number of measures we calculate. However, it should be easy to see that the techniques applied here can be extended naturally to more complex portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that this example is as widely accessible as possible, we have used publicly available data sources. For actual investing use, we strongly recommend investigating paid services to access higher quality data (and which typically requires less processing to use).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes heavy use of Pandas dataframes. If you haven't come across Pandas before, definitely take a look: http://pandas.pydata.org/. Dataframes are an in-memory table object, and have gained popularity for many data-processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",

That's a shame, because one of the really great things about working with Loman is that you can iterate on a single node - even one in the middle of a calculation - without having to recalculate any of the upstream or downstream nodes if you don't want to. In this case, it doesn't make a huge amount of difference, but when dealing with large data sets and time-consuming calculations, it can be a boon not to have to wait a couple of minutes to see the results of your latest update to an intermediate calculation.\n",

To this end, we split **df_holdings** into three separate DataFrames, one for each asset type, in nodes **df_holdings_equity**, **df_holdings_future** and **df_holdings_cash**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a single function for calculating each of the nodes, and provide different values to the `type` parameter. As before, the Loman knows that the df_holdings argument will be populated from the **df_holdings** node. We use the `kwds` parameter to `add_node` to tell Loman that the parameter `type` should be a constant, rather than taken from a node. Thus the **df_holdings_equity** node will be calculated using the **df_holdings** node, and the constant `'Equity'`, and so on."

    "This is serves a practical purpose. Code typically spends the bulk of its life being maintained, so it is important to make that maintenance as easy and fast as possible. Returning to this after several months, it takes a time to reacquaint with even a modest amount of code, while the logical structure and visualization capabilities offered by Loman make it easy to see how a computation occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also benefits when we are first creating code. Because Loman keeps track of state for us, as we interactively add nodes (and possibily take several iterations to get them correct), we do not have to re-run upstream dependencies. Contrast this with a writing a program by adding sub-routines or sections of code. Each re-run would necessitate fetching data from several external websites, and by the end, even in this small case, the process of trying out new iterations becomes quite onerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are other possibilities. An interactive environment such as IPython Notebook requires us to manually keep track ourselves of what needs to be re-run each time. Or a program that serializes data from external websites to disk and then reads in the cached copy also imposes a substantial cognitive load keeping track of that cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution is extensible. It is easy to add new asset types, new measures, or new classifications to cover more complex portfolios, and create more detailed reports. Also, we can combine with other data sources to create entirely new reports - for example, it is easy to imagine using earnings announcement calendars to create a node with a list of equities reporting earnings in the next week, which could be used to provide alerts. Or we could progarm a node to show how near our portfolio is to risk or compliance limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For real-time use, Loman's ability to track state allows us to update different inputs at different cadences. For example, we might update the equity and price nodes every tick, or every few seconds, but update semi-static data less frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also control output cadence by specifying which nodes to calculate, when. We only produce one set of results here, but consider if we had a valuation or risk model that we wanted to use, but which was slow to calculate. We could still calculate P&L at a relatively high frequency, which calculating the more time-consuming model every few minutes, say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our solution is potentially usable in a variety of different contexts. We might have a batch system using this computation graph, to produce daily, or periodic intraday valuations centrally, while the investment team managing a particular portfolio might appreciate the ability to run the same computation graph on their portfolios and model portfolios whenever they desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings us to the end of this example. We looked at how to use Loman to create a basic valuation system for a limited portfolio. In doing so, we explored several tangible benefits that we hope make life easier for quant practitioners.
